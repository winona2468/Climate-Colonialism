                      This semester, I was interested in understanding the relationship between empire and climate risk. 
                      Over the past few centuries, colonialism has violently affected countries across the world. 
                      Today, alongside ongoing relationships of dependence and domination, the effects of colonial encounters persist. 
                      I would like to know if climate risk is among them.
                      To do so, I have taken four separate datasets: 
                        on colonial history, countries in Asia and Africa impacted by colonialism, the CO2 emissions of countries, and the projected climate risk of countries."),

                      This was put together by the Issue Correlates of War (ICOW) Project, 
                      which tried 'to identify colonial or other dependency relationships for each state over the past two centuries.' 
                      The dataset includes the years in which countries were decolonized, as well as characteristics like the type of independence, whether it was violent, etc."),

                      I found this useful because it contains a column specifying the number of years countries were colonized (a variable not found in the previously mentioned dataset).
                      I was interested in whether there is a correlation between number of years colonized and climate risk, so I combined this data with climate vulnerability data for a graph on the second tab.
                      It is important to note that this dataset does not capture important regions in the world like Latin America and Europe. 
                      Nevertheless, it is still interesting to see the results in Asia and Africa, since those regions have been heavily affected by colonialism over time."),

                      One important note is that this dataset was collected in 2011. In the 9 years which have passed since then, our world and individual countries have changed in their increasing susceptibility to environmental harm. 
                      I wonder whether a dataset collected today would reflect significantly different comparative risks across countries.
                      Nevertheless, since this project discusses the effects of the colonial era (especially in the sense of political control, legal status, and physical occupation, all still going strong in the 20th century), perhaps data closer to then is still useful to see."),

                   Second, the data I have used to map out colonial history largely defines the colonial era as ending within the 20th century and moving into a 'postcolonial' era. 
                   Nevertheless, relationships of exploitation and dependency between nations hugely uneqal in power continue to this day, whether it be through systems of global capitalism or claims on 'terrorities' like Puerto Rico (in the case of the United States).
                   To define climate colonialism only by an earlier period is insufficient, and so this project only represents a historical starting point for what is a highly urgent contemporary crisis.
