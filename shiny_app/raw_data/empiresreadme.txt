Disclaimer
While we collected data from various sources and cross-checked dates where possible, our dates might frequently only approximate when changes in control and links took place. Here are some points to take into account when considering the data:

Dates might not be accurate, especially for more ancient empires. A year might rather be indicating a certain decade, or even half a century.

When empires expand or shrink, control might be fluid for a period of time, such that a precise date when control might start or end is a simplification of reality.

Suggestions and comments on dates and/or empire and countries are welcome and may be send to any of the authors.
