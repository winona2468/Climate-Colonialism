# Mapping these data sets (and doing the corresponding recoding work) requires navigating a lot of complex history that I'm having difficulty summarizing into one number. For instance, in the countries data, we have Yemen listed as being decolonized in 1990, but Yemen Peopleâ€™s Republic decolonized in 1967. In the climate data, there is one one 'Yemen Rep.' Which name maps on to which? I ended up choosing to rename Yemen Rep. as Yemen, both to match the later colonization date and also to match wrldsimplmod.
